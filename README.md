Overview

This is a Firebase backed train schedule application. It uses HTML, CSS and jQuery to render the schedule and admin panel on the web page.

Uses Firebase to host a globally available set of data that will be retrieved and manipulated using Momen.js to provide up-to-date information about various trains arrival times and minutes until arrival.

Instructions
Make sure that your app suits this basic spec:


When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
Train Name
Destination 
First Train Time -- in military time
Frequency -- in minutes
Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!
